        <img src="AMALA.jpeg" alt="Amala">
        <p>Amala food is one of the most searched Yoruba dishes on Facebook and a common swallow in
           Nigeria.Most Nigerians love eating this lightweight morsel also called Oka. The good news 
           is that it can be eaten at any time of the day. 
           Amala Nigerian food is mainly eaten by everybody, crisscrossing its way through different 
           tribes, borders and it has gained national status.Initially, the color puts me off, but 
           once I overcame that, I discovered that this West African food is helele (good). Nowadays,
           i eat amala food every other day especially now i know where they sell it near me!
           It’/s like discovering a new world of food delicacy. No food can be likened to it because it
           is so unique. There is no English name for Amala yet. </p>
        <p>What is Amala Food?
           It is a Nigerian food made out of yam flour and/or cassava flour. It is typically eaten by 
           the Yoruba people of Nigeria.Amala food products include yam which is peeled, sliced, dried 
           and then grated or ground into a fine Amala powder known as Elubo. The preparation is
           different from Amala Lafun also known as White Amala.Ever wondered why it is dark brown, 
           Oka derives its color from yam when it turns brown after drying it.
           This process is similar for plantain amala, although unripe plantains are used for that 
           process.Àmàlà and diabetes work hand in hand, especially when missed with plantain flour.</p>

        <h2>4 Easy Steps on How to Make Àmàlà Flour without Lumps</h2>
            <p>Here are the 4 simple steps to making a lump-free amala:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>First, heat water on the fire and allow boiling.</li>
                <li>After that, bring it down from the fire and gradually add your Abebi Yam Flour. 
                    Do not add the yam flour to the water while still on the fire so it doesn’/t form
                    lumps.</li>
                <li>Then, turn the yam flour with a wooden Eba stick (omorogun) quickly so as not to form
                    lumps.</li>
                <li>Turn for a while, add little water and put it back on the fire to cook on low heat for
                    about 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Finally, after 5 minutes, begin to turn the Àmàlà again, keep turning until a smooth 
                    paste is formed. The pulling of the dough into a smooth paste is the most difficult 
                    part of making Elubo.</li>
            </ul>
        <p>Àmàlà can be eaten with various types of soups, which include:
