        <p>Nigerian Egusi Soup with Vegetables (Melon seed soup)<br>
            Egusi Soup With Fresh Fish &Vegetables<br>
            Egusi soup ,also known as Obe Efo elegusi/ Ofe Egusi, is a delicious Nigerian soup that is 
            made with ground melon seeds and enriched with assorted meat, fish and spices. It is 
            actually one of the most popular Nigerian soups used for eating bolus meals such as Pounded 
            Yams, Eba, fufu and wheat meal.It is also popular in other parts of west Africa and the
             cooking methods differs from place to place.<br>
            
            <p>The common variations for cooking Egusi Soup include:<br>
            Variation 1: Egusi soup cooked with vegetables(either spinach/ugu, bitter leaves or a
             combination of both.</p>
             <p>Variation 2: Egusi soup cooked without vegetables</p>
            <p>Variation 3: Frying the ground egusi seeds before adding the palm oil and condiments</p>
            <p>Variation 4: Boiling the assorted meat and fish, then adding the ground egusi seeds,with 
            or without vegetables.</p><br>
            I always urge my friends to try out the different variations (if they can), and they’/ll
             realize that the cooking methods are simply a matter of preference. All that really 
             matters is getting it right and making sure that the ground egusi seeds are properly 
             cooked/fried,to get the raw taste out.

                    Dissolving the egusi is optional, but it helps to reduce burning when frying in 
                    the oil.</li>

                <li>Wash and season the assorted meat and fish with sliced onions, one stock

                    constantly until the soup begins to thicken. Fry for about 15  to 20 minutes 
                    or when you notice the oil rise to the top of the egusi.</li>
